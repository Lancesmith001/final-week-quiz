### Questions

1. A vector is given, `[2,3,9]`. What's the norm?  9.695359714832659

2. I have a biased 6-sided die. P(T) = 0.45. What's the probability, if I flip the coin 100 times, that I will get exactly 14 heads?

f = math.factorial 
(f(100) / (f(14) * f(100-14))) * ((0.55) ** 14) * ((.45) ** 86) = 1.536907716442755

3. What is the rank of a matrix?  The maximum number of linearly independent rows/columns, whichever is smaller, in a matrix.

4. Why is rank important for Linear Regression? 

5. What is the purpose of the sigmoid function in a Logistic Regression model?  sigmoid function returns a probability value which can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes.

6. What is bias vs variance?  Bias is defined as the difference between the prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. The error due to variance is taken as the variability of a model prediction for a given data point. ... Dealing with bias and variance is really about dealing with over- and under-fitting

7. What is a hyperparameter? What part of the dataset (train, validation or test) is responsible for determining this value?  In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins.  Defined using the training dataset.

8. Model selection via cross validation. What part of the dataset (train, validation or test) is responsible for choosing the best model?

9. What is parametric vs non-parametric model?

10. What models do you need to scale the data prior to fitting?

11. What is entropy? Which model uses this concept?

12. How is a random forest generated?

13. How do you determine the correct number of clusters when using KMeans?

14. What is a dendrogram?

15. What is linkage?

16. How does a recommender model work?

17. How can you reduce the number of features in a model?

18. What is a good use of PCA?

19. In general, how do neural networks "learn"?

20. What is your favorite model? Why?
